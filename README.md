# Argos

This project provides some tools to manage Cassandra Cluster.
Argus Panoptes (or Argos) is a 100-eyed giant in Greek mythology. With 50 opened eyes and 50 closed eyes, I guess he can keep an eye on a bunch of Cassandra nodes ;-)

See [Wiki](https://github.com/leleueri/argos/wiki) for documentation.
